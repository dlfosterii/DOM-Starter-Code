        Once there was a miller who was poor, but who had a <span id="adj1">___________</span> daughter.
        Now it happened that he had to go and speak to the king, and in order to make
        himself appear important he said to him, "I have a daughter who can spin straw into <span id="noun1">________</span>."
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The king said to the miller, "That is an art which pleases me well, if your daughter is as
        clever as you say, bring her tomorrow to my <span id="noun2">________</span>, and I will 
        put her to the test."
    </p>

    <p>
        And when the girl was brought to him he took her into a room which was quite full of straw,
        gave her a spinning-wheel and a reel, and said, "Now set to work, and if by to-morrow morning
        early you have not spun this straw into gold during the night, you must die."
    </p>

    <p>
        Thereupon he himself locked up the room, and left her in it alone.
        So there sat the poor miller's daughter, and for the life of her could not tell what to do,
        she had no idea how straw could be spun into gold, and she grew more and more frightened,
        until at last she began to weep.
    </p>

    <p>
        But all at once the door opened, and in came a little man, and said, "Good evening, mistress miller,
        why are you crying so?"
    </p>

    <p>
        "Alas," answered the girl, "I have to spin straw into gold, and I do not know how to do it."
    </p>

    <p>
        "What will you give me," said the manikin, "if I do it for you?"
    </p>

    <p>
        "My necklace," said the girl.
    </p>

    <p>
        The little man took the <span id="noun3">_________</span> , seated himself in front of the wheel,
        and whirr, whirr, whirr, three turns, and the reel was full, then he put another on,
        and whirr, whirr, whirr, three times round, and the second was full too. And so it went
        on until the morning, when all the straw was spun, and all the reels were full of gold.
